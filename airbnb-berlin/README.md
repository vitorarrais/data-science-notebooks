# Findings

1. Avoid Wilmesdorf because is the most expensive neighbourhood by far. 
2. Book in advance if you’re going to visit Berlin in the summer, AirBnB can be very competitive at this time. 
3. In case you want plenty of diverse options like bars, restaurants and nightclubs, you should stay in Neukölln or Prenzlauer Berg.
4. AirBnB prices are increasing each year, which can a be considered good news if you are a host. Fortunately though, prices increase slowly when compared to housing and renting indexes, which have had lots of speculation in recent years.
5. Lastly, a very sad story for AirBnB is the fact that COVID-19 has hit hard the platform early this year.
